# Helpful Links:

## Website:

* Angular webstie 
    * https://angular.dev/overview
* This website has good UI components that we can use:
    * https://material.angular.io/components/categories
 
* Components:
     * components are generally a different web page in the website. Use the default app.component.html componnent for the UI elements that are always present, all other webpages will be children of the app.component.
     * To generate a component: https://angular.dev/cli/generate/component
     * Documentation:https://angular.dev/guide/components
 
  * Routing:
       * app.routing is the file where the routing of the website will go, i.e. what url will take you to what webpage.
       * I think this is the documentation: https://angular.dev/guide/ngmodules/lazy-loading#create-a-feature-module-with-routing
